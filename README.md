# Machine Learning

Notebooks for the course "Machine Learning Fundamentals" given by Andy Louwyck during academic year 2023-2024 at the [Vives University of Applied Sciences](https://www.vives.be/en/vives-international) in Kortrijk, Belgium.

Most topics were developed using the outstanding textbook "[Grokking Machine Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-machine-learning)" by Luis G. Serrano, published in 2021 by Manning:

- topics 1 and 2: introduction
- topics 3 and 4: linear and polynomial regression
- topics 5 and 6: perceptron algorithm and logistic regression
- topic 7: evaluation metrics
- topic 10: decision trees
- topic 12: naive Bayes

For the following topics, I used the 2nd edition of the excellent textbook "[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)" by Aurélien Géron, published in 2019 by O'Reilly Media:

- topic 11: ensemble learning
- topic 15: support vector machines

Other topics are (also) based on the material of the courses Data Science I and II given by Herwig De Smet and Wouter Deketelaere at the [KdG University of Applied Sciences and Arts](https://www.kdg.be/en) in Antwerp within the microdegree Artificial Intelligence & Data Science of the academic year 2019-2020:

- topic 3: linear regression
- topic 7: evaluation metrics
- topic 8: clustering
- topic 13a: association rule learning
- topic 14: timeseries

Topic 9 on k-nearest neighbors and topic 13b on recommender systems were completely developed 'from scratch'.

The learning material of topics 3, 4, 7, and 10 were prepared in collaboration with Dr. Stefaan Haspeslagh, researcher and lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at Vives.
