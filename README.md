Most topics were developed using the outstanding textbook "[Grokking Machine Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-machine-learning)" by Luis G. Serrano, published in 2021 by Manning:

- topics 1 and 2: introduction
- topics 3 and 4: linear and polynomial regression
- topics 5 and 6: perceptron algorithm and logistic regression
- topic 7: evaluation metrics
- topic 10: decision trees
- topic 11: naive Bayes
- topic 14: ensemble learning

Other topics are (also) based on the material of the courses Data Science I and II given by Herwig De Smet and Wouter Deketelaere at the [KdG University of Applied Sciences and Arts](https://www.kdg.be/en) in Antwerp within the microdegree Artificial Intelligence & Data Science of the academic year 2019-2020:

- topic 3: linear regression
- topic 7: evaluation metrics
- topic 8: clustering
- topic 12: timeseries
- topic 13a: association rule learning
- topic 15: principal component analysis

Topic 9 on k-nearest neighbors and topic 13b on recommender systems were completely developed 'from scratch'.

The learning material of topics 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 were prepared in collaboration with Dr. Stefaan Haspeslagh, researcher and lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at Vives.
